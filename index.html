                <p id="name" class="changeMe name text-primary text-center">Recently,	 a	 friend	 showed	 him	 an	 app	
                    for	 online	 shopping	 that	 has	 consistent,	 easy-touse	 navigation	with	 clear	and	 direct	instructions.	
                    Luis	is	able	 to	add	 the	list	of	his	most	 frequently	
                    purchased	 items	 into	 the	 app	 and	 save	 it	 for	
                    future	purchases.	He	likes	the	search	functionality	
                    that	makes	 suggestions	 for	mistyped	 words.	 The	
                    app	 keeps	 a	 running	 total	 of	 the	 items	 in	 his	
                    shopping	cart	which	helps	him	keep	up	with	how	
                    much	 he	 is	 spending.	 His	 friend	 showed	 him	
                    several	 accessibility	 features	 in	 his	 smartphone,	
                    including	word	prediction	and	 the	 text-to-speech	
                    functionality	which	allows	him	to	listen	to	reviews	
                    posted	 by	 other	 users	 on	 the	grocery	app.	Using	
                    these	 tools,	 Luis	 has	 begun	 posting	 his	 reviews	
                    online.	 Now	 he	 uses	 the	 shopping	 app	 for	
                    frequently	purchased	items	and	buys	a	 few	 fresh	
                    items	from	the	store	where	he	works.	</p>
